# WORKBAY DAILY

Terms:

Directives: are classes that add additional behavior to elements in your Angular applications.

Interface: is a way to define a contract on a function with respect to the arguments and their type. Along with functions, an interface can also be used with a Class as well to define custom types.

Service: To keep components lean, services handle discrete operational processes that are more involved than simple these are things like user input validation, console logging, server calls to the server, and any client-side data manipulation.

Subject: involves taking the notifications from a single, source obvervable and forwarding them to one or more destination observers.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests
